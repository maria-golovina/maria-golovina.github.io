            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Maria is a perfumer, olfactory artist, author from Moscow. Since 2015, she has been creating fragrances that resonate on a global scale. As the founder of HOLYNOSE and a collaborator with various international brands, Maria has built a diverse portfolio of nearly 30 commercial perfumes. Her innovative work has been featured in specialized media and her scents are sold worldwide, connecting with people from different cultures through the universal language of perfume.</p>

<p>Maria’s creative perspective is deeply enriched by her passion for East Asian cultures. Fluent in English and Chinese, and having studied Japanese, she possesses a unique linguistic and cultural key to understanding these regions. Her year of living in China and regular travels to both China and Japan are not merely trips, but profound journeys of immersion. This firsthand experience allows her to translate the subtle nuances, ancient traditions, and aesthetic principles of these cultures into the intricate and evocative language of scent.</p>

<p>Current focus: new ways of using and perceiving fragranced products, production transparency, basic olfactory education for all, Asian market, reviving traditional formulas and scent-related practices, shifting eurocentric perspective, scents as a new medium and means of communication, olfactory wellness, sustainability.</p>
